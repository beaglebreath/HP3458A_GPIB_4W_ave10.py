test script to control HP3458A, to measure Fluke 742A-1 1 Ohm resistor, then calculate statistics of measurements.

wire Fluke 742A-1 to the HP 3458A as per AMCS 4-wire Measureing Method.

The specifications for models with CURRENT and SENSE binding posts require
four-wire connections to the standard. Use these binding posts as described in
Table 2.
For the case to act as a shield, the CHASSIS GROUND binding post must be
connected to earth ground or instrumental guard at some point in a calibration
system. Normally when two or more instruments with guards are connected
together, the use of a single common grounding point avoids ground loops. If
applicable, ground the 742A CHASSIS GROUND binding post to that common
grounding point.
